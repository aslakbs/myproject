   <h2>The Problem</h2>
   <p>
     In daily house-articles it is common to find microplastics.
     In wrinkles, bath foam, powder, mascara, sunscreen, hair styling, shaving cream, etc.
     The microplate used in cosmetics and care products is mainly made of polyethylene but may also be
     made of polypropylene, polyethylene or nylon. Typically, microplastic is defined as plastic particles less
     than 5 mm. The type of plastic particles found in care and hygiene products is almost always less than 1 mm.
   </p>
   <p>These are products we use in everyday life, and make up a greater part of global pollution than we think.
     Researchers from OsloMET estimate that of the world's pollution, about 2.5% comes from products containing micro-plastic.</p>
