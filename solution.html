   <h2 id="title_løsning">The Solution</h2>
   <p>
     Our solution is a filtering pipe that separates the micro plastic from the flowing masses of water and
     collects it in a container. The pipe will be installed in the last part of the sewer before the water enter
     the ocean and will by that prevent the micro plastic getting out.

 </p>
   <strong>How does it work?</strong>
   <p>
     The pipe receives all of the water that comes out of the sewer and purification plants.
     There’s a filter in the end of the filtering pipe that lets all of the water through, but collects the micro plastic.
     For the micro plastic not to gather up in the filter and block the flow of water will it continuously and automatically
     be cleaned. By using the energy from the flowing water we can achieve a sucking mechanism that sucks up the micro plastic
     from the filter and into an external container where it will be stored and later transported to a recycling facility.
     The filter holds very high standards and will only need to be switched every 5th year, while the container is large enough
     o contain micro plastic for approximately 6 months before a sensor alerts that it should be emptied.
